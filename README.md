HTML Forms

-Each form is wrapped with the <form></form> element.
-You cannot nest form elements within form elements as that is invalid html.

-The form element has an action and method attribute.
-The action is the location of the script that processes the data.
-The Method could be POST or GET.  
    1) POST just posts the data to the server. You don't see anything in your URL when this happens.
    2) GET will create a query string appended to the URL i.e data is sent inside the URL.

-The 'name' attribute in input elements are used for server-side data processing.
